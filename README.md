# Delta-Reboot
A reboot of an old passion project, starting with much saner goals this time.

Inspired by games like Sundog:Frozen Legacy, elite, FTL, DeltaR plans to be a space trading game, focused more on ship maintainance, with an optimistic goal of "Apollo 13, every 15 minutes".

While the game intends to be many things, so far it isn't much, so many aspects are subject to change.

The main screen will be a top-down view of one's ship, where the player can walk around to interact with various stations/systems, such as the pilots chair, the nav-computer, or deteriorating main engines.

In an effort to keep things relatively simple to learn setup, and for the most portability, it's being written in java using LibGDX.
